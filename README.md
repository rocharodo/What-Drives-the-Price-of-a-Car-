            <h1>Data Problem Definition:</h1>
            <p>
                Identify the key predictive factors that influence the sale price of used cars using a dataset of 426,000 vehicle records.
                Specifically, develop a regression model that explains the variation in sale price based on various attributes such as manufacturer, model, year, odometer, condition, and other relevant features.
                <br />
                The goal is to extract insights on the relationships between these attributes and sale price, ultimately informing feature importance and driving business recommendations for the used car dealership.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Key Objectives:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Identify significant predictors of used car sale price.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quantify the relationships between predictors and sale price.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rank features by importance to inform business decisions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Requirements:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Data preprocessing and feature engineering
                </li>
                <li>
                    Regression modeling (e.g., linear, generalized linear, or tree-based)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feature selection and importance analysis
                </li>
                <li>
                    Model evaluation and validation
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This reframed definition provides a clear direction for the data analysis task, focusing on identifying key drivers of used car prices using regression modeling and feature importance analysis.
